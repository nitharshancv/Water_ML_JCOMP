# Water_ML_JCOMP
Water Potability Classification using ML algorithms, ANN and Weighted Ensembling 

This study uses machine learning (ML) algorithms along with Artificial neural networks (ANN) to automate the analysis and prediction of water potability. To get more information on water potability, the project will use statistical techniques and exploratory data analysis. The water potability for brand-new, untested test data will be predicted using a variety of machine learning classification methods, including Logistic Regression, KNN, LDA, Random Forest, and Decision trees (CART). Along with the above algorithms, a proposed ensemble classifier will also be made and its performance will be validated with the help of the prediction accuracy and would be compared with the machine learning algorithms. The goal is to deliver an effective and precise system that can forecast the water purity for safe consumption.

# Ensemble Model for Water Potability Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates the creation of an ensemble model for predicting water potability using machine learning. The ensemble combines predictions from logistic regression, support vector regression, and random forest regression models.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following libraries installed:
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

You can install them using the following:

pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
git clone https://github.com/your_username/ensemble-water-potability
cd ensemble-water-potability
python ensemble_water_potability.py
